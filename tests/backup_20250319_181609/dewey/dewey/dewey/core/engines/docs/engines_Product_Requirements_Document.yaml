title: External Data/API Engines
decisions:
  patterns: []
  issues: []
executive_summary: 'This project aims to create a suite of Python engines designed
  to access and process data from various external APIs, including financial data
  providers (FRED, Tavily, SEC EDGAR, FMP, Polygon, Yahoo Finance, OpenFIGI), search
  engines (DuckDuckGo, SearxNG, Bing, Serper), and other data sources (GitHub, Gmail,
  PyPI, RSS feeds, MotherDuck). The scope encompasses the development of individual
  engine modules, each responsible for interacting with a specific API, handling authentication,
  managing rate limits, processing data, and providing a consistent interface for
  data retrieval.


  Key components include engines for FRED, Tavily, SEC EDGAR, GitHub, Serper, FMP,
  SearxNG, Bing, consolidated Gmail, MotherDuck, Polygon, PyPI, RSS feeds, Yahoo Finance,
  OpenFIGI, DuckDuckGo, and associated utilities. Each engine leverages libraries
  like `aiohttp`, `asyncio`, `httpx`, and others specific to the API being accessed.
  Responsibilities include API interaction, data transformation, error handling, and
  potentially caching. The `sec_etl.py` component focuses on extracting and storing
  SEC data, while `motherduck_sync.py` handles data synchronization.


  The architecture extends a `BaseEngine` class to promote code reuse and a consistent
  interface across different data sources. Major architectural decisions include the
  use of asynchronous operations for efficient API calls, rate limit management to
  avoid service disruptions, and data processing pipelines to transform raw API responses
  into usable formats. No major architectural changes are explicitly mentioned in
  the provided PRD, but the implementation of caching mechanisms and the handling
  of API key security would be important considerations.'
