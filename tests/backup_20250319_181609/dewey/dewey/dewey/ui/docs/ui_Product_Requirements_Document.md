# Terminal User Interface



## Executive Summary

{'executive_summary': {'overview': 'The Dewey Script Catalog project aims to create a terminal user interface (TUI) application for browsing and managing scripts and modules. The application will leverage the Textual library to provide a rich and interactive user experience within the terminal.', 'architecture': 'The architecture does not currently employ specific architectural patterns. Future iterations may benefit from incorporating patterns to enhance maintainability and scalability.', 'components': 'The primary component is `app.py`, which is responsible for scanning, storing, and displaying script and module information using the Textual UI framework. It manages the main application loop, creates child widgets, and updates the displayed information.', 'critical_issues': 'Currently, there are no identified critical issues. Continuous monitoring and proactive issue identification are recommended as development progresses.', 'next_steps': "The next steps involve further developing the UI elements within `app.py`, implementing features for script execution and management, and exploring potential architectural patterns to improve the application's structure. Thorough testing and user feedback should be incorporated throughout the development process."}}
