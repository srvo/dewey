```python
def initialize_model(model: str) -> None:
    """Initializes a model based on the provided string identifier.

    This function serves as a placeholder for model initialization.  It currently
    doesn't perform any actual initialization but is designed to be extended
    to handle different model types based on the input string.  It's crucial
    to implement the actual model loading or creation logic within this function
    for it to be useful.

    Args:
        model: A string representing the model identifier (e.g., "resnet50", "bert").

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the model identifier is invalid or not supported.  This
            is a placeholder and should be replaced with specific error handling
            for different model types.

    Examples:
        >>> initialize_model("resnet50")
        # (No output, but the model would be initialized internally if implemented)
        >>> initialize_model("bert")
        # (No output, but the model would be initialized internally if implemented)
        >>> try:
        ...     initialize_model("invalid_model")
        ... except ValueError as e:
        ...     print(e)
        Invalid model identifier: invalid_model
    """
    if not isinstance(model, str):
        raise TypeError(f"Model identifier must be a string, got {type(model)}")

    if model == "resnet50":
        # Placeholder for ResNet50 initialization
        print("Initializing ResNet50...")
        # Add actual ResNet50 initialization code here
        pass
    elif model == "bert":
        # Placeholder for BERT initialization
        print("Initializing BERT...")
        # Add actual BERT initialization code here
        pass
    elif model == "gpt2":
        # Placeholder for GPT-2 initialization
        print("Initializing GPT-2...")
        # Add actual GPT-2 initialization code here
        pass
    elif model == "transformer":
        # Placeholder for a generic transformer model
        print("Initializing Transformer...")
        # Add actual transformer initialization code here
        pass
    elif model == "":
        raise ValueError("Model identifier cannot be an empty string.")
    else:
