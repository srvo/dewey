Key improvements and explanations:

* **Comprehensive Docstrings:**  The docstrings are now complete, following Google style, and explain the purpose of the class and each method, including arguments, return values, and any potential exceptions.  They also explain the purpose of each attribute.
* **Type Hints:**  All arguments and return values are type-hinted for clarity and static analysis.  `Optional` is used correctly.
* **Edge Case Handling:**
    *   Handles the case where `tx_hash` or `description` are `None` gracefully.  The `__init__` method uses `or 'N/A'` to provide a default value for the base exception message.
    *   The `__str__` method handles the case where `description` is `None`.
* **Modern Python Conventions:**
    *   Uses f-strings for string formatting, which is the preferred method in modern Python.
    *   Uses type hints.
    *   Includes `__repr__` for debugging.
* **Clear Error Message:** The `__init__` method constructs a clear and informative error message that includes the transaction hash (or "N/A" if it's not provided).
* **Inheritance from `Exception`:** The class correctly inherits from the built-in `Exception` class, making it a proper custom exception.
* **`__str__` and `__repr__`:**  The `__str__` method provides a user-friendly representation, while `__repr__` provides a developer-friendly representation for debugging.  The `__repr__` method now correctly includes the message from the base class.
* **No unnecessary imports:** No unnecessary imports are included.
* **Conciseness:** The code is written concisely and efficiently.
* **Correctness:** The code accurately reflects the intended functionality.
* **Readability:** The code is well-formatted and easy to read.

This improved version addresses all the requirements, provides a robust and well-documented custom exception class, and adheres to modern Python best practices.  It's ready to be used in a production environment.
