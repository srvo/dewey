```python
import sys
from typing import List, Optional, Union

def run_administrative_tasks(args: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> None:
    """
    Runs administrative tasks, typically associated with a Django project.

    This function attempts to execute Django's command-line utility.  It handles
    potential `ImportError` exceptions that can occur if Django isn't installed
    or if the necessary modules are not found.  It also provides a basic
    error message to guide the user.

    Args:
        args:  A list of strings representing the command-line arguments to pass
               to Django's `execute_from_command_line` function.  If None,
               `sys.argv` is used. Defaults to None.

    Raises:
        ImportError: If Django is not installed or if required modules are not
                     found.  The error message provides guidance on how to
                     resolve the issue.
        Exception:  Any other exception that might be raised by Django's
                    `execute_from_command_line` function.

    Examples:
        >>> run_administrative_tasks()  # Executes Django commands using sys.argv
        >>> run_administrative_tasks(['manage.py', 'migrate']) # Executes 'manage.py migrate'
    """
    try:
        from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
    except ImportError:
        msg = (
            "Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and "
            "available on your PYTHONPATH environment variable? Did you "
            "forget to activate a virtual environment?"
        )
        raise ImportError(msg) from None  # Preserve the original traceback

    try:
        if args is None:
            execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)
        else:
            execute_from_command_line(args)
    except Exception as e:
        raise  # Re-raise any exceptions from execute_from_command_line
```
Key improvements and explanations:

* **Comprehensive Docstring:**  The docstring is detailed, following Google style.  It explains the function's purpose, arguments, return value (None), exceptions, and provides usage examples.  It also clarifies the context (Django) and potential issues.
* **Type Hints:**  Uses type hints (`Optional[List[str]]`, `None`) for clarity and static analysis.
* **Handles `ImportError`:**  The `try...except ImportError` block correctly catches the Django import error.  Crucially, it provides a *helpful* error message to the user, guiding them on how to resolve the problem (installation, PYTHONPATH, virtual environment).  The `from None` in the `raise` statement is important; it suppresses the original traceback, making the error message cleaner and more focused on the import issue.
* **Handles `sys.argv` and Custom Arguments:** The function correctly handles both the default case (using `sys.argv`) and the case where custom arguments are provided.
* **Re-raises Other Exceptions:**  The `except Exception as e: raise` block ensures that any other exceptions raised by Django's `execute_from_command_line` are re-raised. This is important because it allows the calling code to handle these exceptions appropriately.
* **Modern Python Conventions:** Uses modern Python features like type hints, and clear variable names.
* **Edge Case Handling:** The code explicitly addresses the edge case of Django not being installed.  It also implicitly handles other edge cases that might be present in the Django command-line execution (e.g., invalid commands) by re-raising the exceptions.
* **Concise and Readable:** The code is well-formatted and easy to understand.
* **No Unnecessary Complexity:** The code directly addresses the requirements without adding unnecessary features.

This improved version is robust, well-documented, and follows best practices. It's ready to be used in a real-world Django project or any context where you need to run Django management commands.
