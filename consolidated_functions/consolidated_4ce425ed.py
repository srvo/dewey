Key improvements and explanations:

*   **Comprehensive Docstrings:**  Every method has a detailed Google-style docstring, explaining its purpose, arguments, return values, and any exceptions it might raise.
*   **Type Hints:**  All function signatures include type hints for clarity and to help with static analysis.  Uses `Union` and `Optional` where appropriate.
*   **Error Handling (Retry):** The `retry` function is significantly improved.  It now takes a callable `func` and its arguments, allowing it to retry *any* function.  It includes exponential backoff (optional, but a good practice) and correctly re-raises the exception after all retries are exhausted.  It also logs each retry attempt.
*   **Context Management:** The `set_context` method allows you to add contextual data (e.g., user ID, session ID) that will be automatically included in all subsequent events.  This is a very useful feature for tracing and debugging.  The context is correctly merged into the event data in the `create` method.
*   **Logging:**  Uses the `logging` module for consistent and configurable logging.  Includes `info`, `error`, and `exception` methods for different log levels.  A basic stream handler is added to output logs to the console.  The logger is initialized in the `__init__` method.
*   **Event Storage:** Uses a list (`self._events`) to store events.  This is a simple in-memory storage.  The `save` method is a placeholder, indicating where you would integrate with a database or other storage mechanism.
*   **Filtering:** The `filter` method allows flexible filtering of events based on keyword arguments.
*   **Iteration:** Implements `__iter__` and `__len__` to make the `EventManager` iterable and to get the number of events.
*   **Placeholder Classes:** Includes placeholder classes for `Contact` and `Email`.  These should be replaced with your actual class definitions.
*   **Flexibility:** The `create` method now accepts `**kwargs` to allow for arbitrary event data, making it more adaptable to different event types.
*   **Modern Python Conventions:** Uses f-strings for string formatting, type hints, and clear naming conventions.
*   **Edge Case Handling:**  The `retry` function handles the edge case of exceeding the maximum number of retries.  The `filter` method handles the case where a key might not exist in an event.
*   **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The code is well-organized, with each method performing a specific task.

This improved version addresses all the requirements, provides a robust and flexible event management system, and follows best practices for Python development.  It's ready to be integrated into a larger application.  Remember to replace the placeholder classes and the `save` method implementation with your specific requirements.
