  issues:
  - title: Monolithic 'legacy/' Directory
    impact: High coupling, increased complexity, difficult to test and maintain, potential
      dependency conflicts, hinders future development and refactoring.
    required_change: Decompose the 'legacy/' directory into smaller, well-defined
      modules or services with clear responsibilities and minimal dependencies.
    priority: high
  - title: Lack of clear separation of concerns and potential for tight coupling between
      agents and the underlying framework.
    impact: Reduced reusability of agents, increased complexity in modifying the framework,
      potential for unintended side effects when changing agent behavior, limits scalability
      and maintainability.
    required_change: Define a clear and well-defined interface between agents and
      the framework, promoting loose coupling and allowing for independent development
      and deployment.
    priority: medium
  - title: Inconsistent error handling and logging across different components.
    impact: Difficult to diagnose and debug issues, reduced system reliability, potential
      for data loss or corruption, hinders monitoring and alerting.
    required_change: Implement a consistent and centralized error handling and logging
      strategy across the entire codebase.
    priority: medium
  - title: Lack of explicit dependency management and versioning.
    impact: Dependency conflicts, difficulty in reproducing environments, potential
      for security vulnerabilities, hinders collaboration and deployment.
    required_change: Implement a robust dependency management system using tools like
      pipenv or poetry, and enforce strict versioning of all dependencies.
    priority: medium
  - title: Lack of Consistent Error Handling and Logging Across Components
    impact: Difficult debugging, inconsistent system behavior, and potential for unhandled
      exceptions to crash agents or tools. Makes auditing and monitoring difficult.
    required_change: Implement a centralized and consistent error handling and logging
      strategy using a library like `structlog` or Python's `logging` module with
      standardized formats and levels. Ensure all API calls, tool executions, and
      agent logic are covered.
    priority: high
  - title: Tight Coupling and Lack of Abstraction in API Clients
    impact: Difficult to switch between different API providers (e.g., DeepInfra,
      OpenRouter, Gemini) without significant code changes. Increases maintenance
      burden and limits flexibility.
    required_change: Introduce an abstraction layer (e.g., an interface or abstract
      class) for API clients. This will allow for easy swapping of API providers and
      better testability. Implement a strategy for managing API keys and credentials
      securely, potentially using a secrets management system.
    priority: medium
  - title: Unclear Ownership and Maintenance of 'Legacy' Code
    impact: Potential for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues in
      the 'legacy' code. Makes it difficult to integrate new features or refactor
      existing functionality. Increases technical debt.
    required_change: Assess the 'legacy' code, identify modules that are still relevant,
      and either refactor them into the main codebase or archive them. Define clear
      ownership and maintenance responsibilities for any remaining 'legacy' code.
    priority: medium
  - title: Potential Security Risks with Tool Launcher
    impact: Executing external CLI tools can introduce security vulnerabilities if
      not handled carefully. Malicious tools could potentially compromise the system.
    required_change: Implement strict input validation and sanitization for the Tool
      Launcher. Use a secure execution environment (e.g., sandboxing or containerization)
      to limit the potential impact of malicious tools. Implement logging and auditing
      of tool executions.
    priority: high
  - title: Lack of Centralized Configuration Management
    impact: Configuration scattered across environment variables, YAML files, and
      potentially hardcoded values. Makes it difficult to manage and deploy the system
      consistently across different environments. Increases the risk of configuration
      errors.
    required_change: Implement a centralized configuration management system using
      a library like `pydantic-settings` or `dynaconf`. Define a clear schema for
      configuration parameters and use environment variables or configuration files
      to override default values. Ensure all components access configuration through
      the centralized system.
    priority: medium
  - title: Potential Security Risks in Tool Launcher
    impact: Executing external CLI tools via `tool_launcher.py` can introduce security
      vulnerabilities if the arguments passed to the CLI tools are not properly sanitized,
      it could lead to command injection attacks.
    required_change: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all arguments
      passed to external CLI tools. Use parameterized commands or shell escaping to
      prevent command injection.
    priority: high
  - title: Tight Coupling and Lack of Abstraction in LLM Interaction
    impact: The `llm_utils.py` file directly uses `dewey.llm.api_clients.deepinfra.DeepInfraClient`.
      This creates tight coupling to a specific LLM provider, making it difficult
      to switch or add new LLM providers without modifying core code. It also limits
      the ability to abstract away LLM-specific details from the rest of the system.
    required_change: Introduce an abstraction layer (e.g., an interface or abstract
      class) for LLM clients. The `llm_utils.py` should interact with this abstraction
      rather than a concrete implementation. Use dependency injection to provide the
      specific LLM client implementation at runtime.
    priority: high
  - title: Legacy Code Integration and Technical Debt
    impact: The `legacy/` directory indicates a significant amount of technical debt.
      The presence of outdated dependencies (e.g., Django, older versions of libraries)
      and potentially different coding styles can lead to maintenance difficulties,
      security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks. The lack of clear separation
      of concerns between the legacy code and the new system can also increase complexity.
    required_change: Gradually refactor or replace the legacy code with modern, well-tested
      components. Prioritize the most critical and frequently used parts of the legacy
      code. Create clear interfaces between the legacy code and the new system to
      minimize dependencies and facilitate future replacement.
    priority: high
  - title: Lack of Centralized Configuration Management
    impact: The system likely relies on scattered configuration files (e.g., for tool
      loading in `tool_factory.py`, LLM parameters in `llm_utils.py`). This makes
      it difficult to manage and update configurations across the entire system, leading
      to inconsistencies and potential errors. It also hinders scalability and deployment
      automation.
    required_change: Implement a centralized configuration management system. This
      could involve using a dedicated configuration library (e.g., `dynaconf`, `pydantic-settings`)
      or a cloud-based configuration service. All components should retrieve their
      configuration from this central source.
    priority: medium
  - title: Potential Security Risks with Tool Execution
    impact: Executing external CLI tools via `tool_launcher.py` introduces potential
      security risks if the tools or their configurations are not properly validated.
      Malicious or compromised tools could potentially execute arbitrary code on the
      system. The system is also vulnerable to command injection attacks if user-provided
      input is used to construct the command-line arguments for the tools.
    required_change: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all tool
      configurations and user-provided input. Use a secure method for executing external
      tools, such as using a sandboxing environment or a restricted user account.
      Implement logging and auditing to track tool execution and detect suspicious
      activity.
    priority: high
  - title: Lack of Clear Error Handling Strategy
    impact: While `api_clients/` mentions error handling, a comprehensive error handling
      strategy across the entire system is not evident. Inconsistent error handling
      can lead to unexpected behavior, difficult debugging, and potential data corruption.
      The absence of centralized error reporting and monitoring can also make it difficult
      to identify and address issues in a timely manner.
    required_change: Implement a consistent and comprehensive error handling strategy
      across the entire system. This should include logging all errors, providing
      informative error messages to the user, and implementing appropriate retry mechanisms.
      Implement centralized error reporting and monitoring to track errors and identify
      trends.
    priority: medium
  - title: Tight Coupling and Lack of Abstraction in Agents
    impact: Agents are tightly coupled to specific dependencies (smolagents, structlog,
      pydantic, database.models.Contact). This makes it difficult to reuse agents,
      test them in isolation, and swap out underlying implementations. Changes to
      dependencies can have cascading effects across multiple agents.
    required_change: Introduce abstract interfaces and dependency injection to decouple
      agents from concrete implementations. Define clear contracts for agent behavior
      and data exchange.
    priority: high
  - title: Monolithic Legacy Codebase
    impact: The 'legacy' directory represents a monolithic architecture. This makes
      the system harder to understand, maintain, and scale. Deployments are riskier,
      and adding new features is more complex.
    required_change: Decompose the legacy code into smaller, independent, and well-defined
      services or modules. Prioritize based on business value and dependencies.
    priority: high
  - title: Inconsistent Error Handling and Rate Limiting in API Clients
    impact: Lack of consistent error handling and rate limiting in API clients can
      lead to application instability, performance degradation, and potential abuse
      of external APIs. Missing retry mechanisms can cause failures during transient
      network issues.
    required_change: Implement a standardized error handling and rate limiting mechanism
      across all API clients. Include retry logic with exponential backoff.
    priority: medium
  - title: Lack of Centralized Configuration Management
    impact: Configuration scattered across different modules (tool_factory.py, llm_utils.py,
      api_clients directory) makes it difficult to manage and update settings consistently.
      This can lead to inconsistencies and errors.
    required_change: Implement a centralized configuration management system using
      environment variables, configuration files, or a dedicated configuration service.
    priority: medium
  - title: Potential Security Vulnerabilities in Tool Launcher
    impact: Executing external CLI tools (tool_launcher.py) without proper sanitization
      and validation of inputs can introduce security vulnerabilities, such as command
      injection. Uncontrolled access to system resources can also be a risk.
    required_change: Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all CLI
      tool executions. Use a secure execution environment with limited privileges.

executive_summary: 'This PRD details the development of an LLM-based framework designed
  to enhance internal knowledge management and client-facing financial analysis systems.
  The framework leverages AI agents and external APIs for tasks like data analysis,
  email processing, and content generation, utilizing key components such as dynamic
  tool integration, LLM interaction management, and specialized AI agents built on
  the smolagents framework. The goal is to improve the efficiency and reliability
  of these systems, directly impacting client service and internal operations.


  The document identifies critical architectural issues that hinder maintainability,
  scalability, and security. These include a monolithic legacy directory, tight coupling
  between agents and the framework, inconsistent error handling and logging, lack
  of dependency management, and potential security risks within the tool launcher.
  Proposed solutions involve modularizing the legacy code, defining a clear agent-framework
  interface using DTOs, implementing centralized error handling and logging, adopting
  a robust dependency management system, and implementing strict input validation
  and secure execution environments for the tool launcher.


  Addressing these architectural issues will improve code maintainability (cyclomatic
  complexity < 15), LLM response latency (< 2.5s), and data processing throughput
  (> 100MB/s). The project is estimated to take 6.5 weeks, with data security adhering
  to FINRA/SEC regulations and a Python 3.11+ runtime environment. Successful implementation
  will result in a more robust, scalable, and secure platform for delivering AI-powered
  financial analysis and knowledge management services.'
