# LLM Module Product Requirements Document

This project focuses on building and maintaining an LLM-powered system, encompassing tool creation, API integration, and agent-based functionalities. Key components include `tool_factory.py` for creating LLM tools, `llm_utils.py` for LLM interactions, `tool_launcher.py` for executing external tools, `api_clients` for interacting with LLM providers, and `agents` for AI agent implementations. A `legacy` directory houses older implementations.

The architecture employs patterns like Tooling and Utilities, API Client Abstraction, and Agent-based Architecture. However, several issues require attention. High-priority concerns include the lack of a clear API definition and versioning for the tool factory and launcher, and the need for documentation and testing for API clients. Medium-priority issues involve refactoring `llm_utils.py` for clarity, defining a clear agent architecture, addressing the scope and potential technical debt in the `legacy` directory, and ensuring consistent exception handling. Addressing these issues will improve maintainability, scalability, and reliability of the LLM system.

## Architectural Decisions

### Patterns

- Tooling and Utilities
- API Client Abstraction
- Agent-based Architecture
- Legacy Code Segregation

### Critical Issues

#### Lack of Clear API Definition and Versioning for Tool Factory and Launcher

**Impact:** Tight coupling between tools and the launcher, making it difficult to add new tools or modify existing ones without breaking the system. No clear contract for how tools should interact with the launcher.

**Required Change:** Define a clear interface (e.g., abstract base class or protocol) for tools to implement. Implement versioning for the tool interface to allow for backward compatibility and graceful upgrades.

**Priority:** high

#### Unclear Structure and Purpose of 'llm_utils.py'

**Impact:** Potentially a dumping ground for unrelated utility functions, leading to code bloat and reduced maintainability. Lack of clear responsibility makes it difficult to understand and refactor.

**Required Change:** Analyze the contents of `llm_utils.py`. Refactor it into smaller, more focused modules based on functionality. Document the purpose of each utility function and its dependencies.

**Priority:** medium

#### Ambiguous Structure and Purpose of 'agents' Directory

**Impact:** Lack of clarity on how agents are defined, managed, and interact with the rest of the system. Potential for inconsistent agent implementations and difficulty in scaling the agent architecture.

**Required Change:** Define a clear agent architecture, including agent lifecycle, communication mechanisms, and data structures. Establish guidelines for creating and managing agents. Consider using a framework or library for agent management.

**Priority:** medium

#### Lack of Documentation and Testing for API Clients

**Impact:** Difficult to understand how to use the API clients correctly and ensure their reliability. Changes to LLM APIs could break the system without proper testing.

**Required Change:** Add comprehensive documentation for each API client, including usage examples and error handling. Implement unit and integration tests to verify the functionality and resilience of the API clients.

**Priority:** high

#### Unknown Scope and Potential Technical Debt in 'legacy' Directory

**Impact:** The 'legacy' directory likely contains outdated or poorly maintained code that could introduce bugs or security vulnerabilities. It also increases the complexity of the codebase and makes it harder to understand.

**Required Change:** Thoroughly review the code in the 'legacy' directory. Identify code that can be removed, refactored, or migrated to the current architecture. Document the rationale for keeping any legacy code and create a plan for its eventual removal.

**Priority:** medium

#### Inconsistent Exception Handling

**Impact:** Inconsistent error handling can lead to unexpected behavior, difficult debugging, and reduced system reliability. Lack of standardized exception types makes it harder to handle errors gracefully.

**Required Change:** Review the `exceptions.py` file and ensure that all exceptions are properly defined and used consistently throughout the module. Implement a consistent error handling strategy, including logging and reporting.

**Priority:** medium
