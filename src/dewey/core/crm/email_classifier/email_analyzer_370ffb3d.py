"""Email Analyzer using SQLAlchemy ORM.

This module provides functionality to analyze raw emails stored in a SQLite database
using SQLAlchemy's ORM capabilities. It processes unprocessed emails, updates their
status, and handles errors gracefully with proper transaction management.

The module includes:
- Database connection setup using SQLAlchemy
- Email processing logic with logging
- Error handling and transaction management
