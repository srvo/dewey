"""Action Manager Module.

This module provides functionality for executing various email-related actions based on
defined rules and email data. It serves as the central point for managing all email
processing actions within the system.

Key Features:
- Action execution with comprehensive logging
- Error handling and reporting
- Future extensibility for new action types

The module is designed to be integrated with the email processing pipeline and works
in conjunction with the rules engine to determine appropriate actions for each email.

    This function serves as the main entry point for executing email-related actions.

    Args:
    ----
        action (str): The action to execute. Supported actions include:
            - 'archive': Move email to archive
            - 'label': Apply specific labels
            - 'forward': Forward email to another address
            - 'delete': Permanently delete email
            - 'mark_read': Mark email as read
        email_data (Dict[str, Any]): Dictionary containing email metadata and content.
            Expected keys:
            - message_id: Unique identifier for the email
            - subject: Email subject line
            - from: Sender's email address
            - to: Recipient email addresses
            - date: Timestamp of email

        logic will be implemented as part of the action pipeline development.
