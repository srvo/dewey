# Database Operations



## Executive Summary

This project focuses on developing a robust and streamlined data handling solution for database operations. The scope encompasses the creation of a `data_handler.py` class, designed to provide a consistent and controlled interface for managing data through CRUD operations. The class will abstract away the underlying data storage mechanism, offering a unified approach to data access, processing, and storage.

The core component is the `data_handler.py` class, responsible for all data operations. It will handle data initialization, validation, and loading, providing a concise representation of the data object's state. The class will manage data operations, ensuring a consistent interface for interacting with the data.

No major architectural decisions or changes are currently identified in the provided PRD. The focus is on implementing the `data_handler.py` class to meet the defined responsibilities, including data management, representation, and abstraction of the underlying storage mechanism.

## Components

### data_handler.py

A comprehensive data processing class that combines initialization and representation functionalities.

    This class provides a streamlined way to represent and initialize data objects,
    handling potential edge cases and adhering to modern Python conventions.

#### Responsibilities

- Manages data operations including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Provides a consistent and controlled interface for data access.
- Should provide a concise and informative summary of the object's state.
- May include key attributes or configurations.
- Returns a string representation of the DataHandler object, useful for debugging and logging.
- Initializes the DataHandler object with necessary dependencies (e.g., database connection, file path).
- Sets up internal data structures or connections required for data operations.
- May handle data validation and sanitization.
- May load initial data or configurations.
- Handles data loading, processing, and storage.
- Abstracts away the underlying data storage mechanism.
