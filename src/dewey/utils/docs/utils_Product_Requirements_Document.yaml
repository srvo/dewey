components:
  vector_db.py:
    description: Vector database operations for code consolidation using ChromaDB.
    responsibilities:
    - Store and manage code embeddings using ChromaDB.
    - Generate embeddings for function context.
    - Find similar functions based on embeddings and metadata.
    dependencies:
    - chromadb library
    - __future__ library
    - src library
    - pathlib library
    - sentence_transformers library
  ingestion/data_import_1a125870_1.py:
    description: 'Client Data Import Module.


      This module handles the import of client data from CSV files into a SQLite database.

      It processes two main data sources:

      1. Households data containing client-level information

      2. Accounts data containing individual account details


      The module creates two tables in the database:

      - clients: Stores household-level client information

      - client_accounts: Stores individual account details linked to households


      Key Features:

      - Data validation and cleaning

      - Error logging and reporting

      - Database schema management

      - Bulk data import with transaction handling'
    responsibilities:
    - Import client data from CSV files into an SQLite database.
    dependencies:
    - sqlite3 library
    - pandas library
  parsing/markdown.py:
    description: No description available.
    responsibilities:
    - Parse a header line
    - Extract header level and title
    - Update the document structure
    - Parse markdown file
    - Parse arguments
    - Calculate document statistics
    - Determine the code block language
    - Handle the end of a code block
    - Generate schema
    - Handle the start of a code block
    - Process a header line
    - Extract structure and statistics from lines
    - Return structured schema with statistics

  executive_summary:
    overview: 'This project focuses on providing utility functions across several
      key areas: vector database operations for code consolidation, client data ingestion
      from CSV files into a SQLite database, and markdown parsing for document structure
      and statistics extraction. The goal is to create reusable and efficient modules
      for managing code embeddings, importing client data, and processing markdown
      documents.'
    architecture: The architecture is component-based, with each module designed for
      a specific task. There are currently no explicitly defined architectural patterns
      documented.
    components:
      vector_db.py: Manages code embeddings using ChromaDB for finding similar functions.
      ingestion/data_import_1a125870_1.py: Imports client data from CSV files into
        an SQLite database, handling data validation and cleaning.
      parsing/markdown.py: Parses markdown files to extract structure, statistics,
        and schema information.
    issues: No critical issues are currently identified.
    next_steps: The next steps involve thorough testing of each component, documenting
      inter-component dependencies more explicitly, and exploring potential architectural
      patterns to improve maintainability and scalability. Further investigation into
      error handling and edge cases for each module is also recommended.
