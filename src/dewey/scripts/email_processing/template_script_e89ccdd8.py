"""Template script for email processing system.

This template provides a standardized structure for creating new scripts
in the email processing system. It includes logging, database connection
handling, and error management.

Key Features:
- Automatic logger setup with script-specific context
- Database connection management
- Standardized error handling and logging
- Processing statistics collection
- Main function template with execution flow

Copy this file to create new scripts, maintaining the established
patterns and conventions.
