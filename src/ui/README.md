# User Interface (UI) Components

This directory contains the user interface components for the Dewey application.

## Directory Structure

- `/components`: Reusable UI components used across different screens
- `/screens`: Screen views and layouts
- `/runners`: Script runners for executing various UI components
- `/research`: Research dashboard and visualization components
- `/docs`: Documentation including Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- `/assets`: UI assets including CSS files

## Implementation

The Dewey UI uses the Textual library for Terminal User Interface (TUI) development.
The primary entry point is `run_tui.py` which launches the application.

## History

This directory consolidates UI components previously split between:
- `/src/ui` (TUI components)
- `/src/dewey/ui` (older script-based interfaces)
