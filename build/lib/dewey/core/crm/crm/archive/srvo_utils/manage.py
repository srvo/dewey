"""Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks.

This script serves as the entry point for Django's command-line interface.
It handles:
- Setting up the Django environment
- Executing management commands
- Error handling for common setup issues
- Providing helpful error messages for common problems

Typical usage:
    python manage.py <command> [options]

Example commands:
    python manage.py runserver      # Start development server
    python manage.py migrate        # Apply database migrations
    python manage.py createsuperuser  # Create admin user
    python manage.py shell          # Start Django shell
    python manage.py test           # Run test suite

Environment Variables:
    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: Specifies which settings module to use
    PYTHONPATH: Should include path to Django installation
    DEBUG: Set to True for development, False for production

Error Handling:
    - Provides clear error messages for common setup issues
    - Handles missing dependencies gracefully
    - Validates environment configuration

Security Considerations:
    - Never run with DEBUG=True in production
    - Use different settings modules for development and production
    - Keep secret keys and credentials in environment variables

def main() -> NoReturn:
    """Run administrative tasks for Django project.

    This is the main entry point for Django's command-line interface.
    It handles setting up the Django environment and executing management commands.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Sets the default Django settings module if not already set
    2. Attempts to import Django's execute_from_command_line function
    3. Executes the requested command with provided arguments
    4. Handles errors and provides helpful feedback

    The function never returns (NoReturn) as it either:
    - Successfully executes the command and exits
    - Raises an exception and exits with error

    Args:
        None (uses sys.argv for command line arguments)

    Returns:
        NoReturn: Always exits the program

    Raises:
        ImportError: If Django is not installed or not available in PYTHONPATH
        CommandError: If the requested command fails
        RuntimeError: If there are issues with environment configuration

    Example:
        $ python manage.py runserver
        Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

        $ python manage.py migrate
        Applying migrations...

        $ python manage.py createsuperuser
        Username: admin

    Security Considerations:
        - Never run with DEBUG=True in production
        - Use different settings modules for development and production
        - Keep secret keys and credentials in environment variables
        - Ensure ALLOWED_HOSTS is properly configured
        - Set proper database permissions
        - Use HTTPS in production environments
        - Regularly update dependencies
        - Implement proper access controls

    Performance Notes:
        - Use connection pooling for database operations
        - Enable caching for frequently accessed data
        - Optimize database queries
        - Use asynchronous tasks for long-running operations

    Debugging Tips:
        - Use django-debug-toolbar for development
        - Check logs for error messages
        - Use Django's shell_plus for interactive debugging
        - Enable SQL logging for query optimization

    Implementation Details:
        - The function uses Django's execute_from_command_line to handle command execution
        - Environment variables are checked before setting defaults
        - Error handling provides detailed feedback for common setup issues
        - The function is designed to be called directly from the command line
        - All Django management commands are supported through this entry point

    Version History:
        - 1.0.0: Initial implementation
        - 1.1.0: Added enhanced error handling and documentation
        - 1.2.0: Improved security considerations and performance notes

    """Main entry point when executed as a script.
    
    This block ensures the main() function is called when the script is executed directly,
    but not when the file is imported as a module.
    
    The if __name__ == "__main__" guard is a Python idiom that allows a file to:
    - Be imported as a module without executing the main logic
    - Be run as a script to execute the main logic
    
    This pattern is particularly useful for:
    - Creating reusable modules
    - Writing testable code
    - Providing command-line interfaces
    - Maintaining clean separation of concerns
    
    Example:
        # As a script
        $ python manage.py runserver
        
        # As a module
        import manage
        # No automatic execution
        
    Best Practices:
        - Keep main() function minimal
        - Move business logic to separate modules
        - Use proper error handling
        - Document command-line arguments
        - Provide help/usage information
