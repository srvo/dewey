# Migration Process Summary

## Overview

We've created a system to compare code between the old Dewey codebase (`/Users/srvo/dewey/old_dewey`) and the new codebase (`/Users/srvo/dewey/src`), generate migration scripts, and execute them to bring improvements from the old codebase to the new one.

## Tools Created

1. **codebase_comparison.py** - Analyzes both codebases and generates migration scripts based on which files in the old codebase might be more interesting or valuable than their counterparts in the new codebase.

2. **fix_migration_scripts.py** - Fixes common indentation and syntax issues in the generated migration scripts to ensure they can be executed without errors.

3. **run_migrations.py** - Executes migration scripts with options for parallelism and filtering by pattern.

4. **fix_script_extensions.py** - Fixes incorrect file extensions for migration scripts.

## Current Status

- We've generated 1,476 migration scripts for various files that should be migrated from the old to the new codebase.
- We've fixed indentation and syntax issues in 753 migration scripts.
- We've successfully tested migrations for specific files like `llm_utils.py`, `ledger_checker.py`, `vector_db.py`, and `deepinfra.py`.

## How to Continue

1. **Run the migration scripts in batches**:
   ```bash
   # Run all migration scripts with 8 parallel workers
   python /Users/srvo/dewey/run_migrations.py --parallel 8
   
   # Run only scripts matching a pattern
   python /Users/srvo/dewey/run_migrations.py --pattern "llm" --parallel 4
   ```

2. **Handle migration errors**:
   - If a migration script fails due to incorrect file paths, check if the file exists in a different location and update the script accordingly.
   - If a migration script fails due to syntax errors, use the `fix_migration_scripts.py` tool to fix it:
     ```bash
     python /Users/srvo/dewey/fix_migration_scripts.py --pattern "problematic_file.py"
     ```

3. **Review migrated files**:
   - After running the migrations, examine the new codebase to ensure the migrations have been applied correctly.
   - Pay special attention to files that use `BaseScript` integration as this is a significant change.

4. **Run tests**:
   - Execute tests on the migrated codebase to ensure functionality is maintained.

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Consider a Phased Approach**:
   - Instead of migrating all files at once, consider a phased approach by module or functionality.
   - This allows for better testing and validation of each component.

2. **Backup Strategy**:
   - The migration scripts create backups of existing files before overwriting them, but it's good practice to also have a separate backup of the entire codebase.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document any changes or decisions made during the migration process.
   - This is especially important for custom modifications or special handling of certain files.

4. **Post-Migration Cleanup**:
   - After completing the migrations, consider removing temporary files and directories.
   - This includes migration scripts that are no longer needed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter persistent issues with specific migration scripts, you can manually examine and modify them using:
```bash
# View a script's content
cat /Users/srvo/dewey/migration_scripts/problematic_file.py

# Edit a script
nano /Users/srvo/dewey/migration_scripts/problematic_file.py
```

The most common issues tend to be:
- Incorrect file paths (especially if the directory structure differs between old and new codebases)
- Syntax errors in the migration script
- Missing directories in the new codebase (the scripts should create them, but additional directories might be needed)

## Migration Report

A migration report is generated after each run of `run_migrations.py` and saved to `migration_report.md`. This report provides details on which migrations succeeded and which failed.
