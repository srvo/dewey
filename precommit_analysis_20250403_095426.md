Okay, I will analyze the pre-commit hook output and provide a comprehensive, actionable plan for fixing the identified issues.

## Executive Summary

The pre-commit hooks identified trailing whitespace issues in several Python files.  While not critical, these issues contribute to code clutter and can affect readability and potentially introduce subtle bugs in rare cases. The `trim-trailing-whitespace` hook automatically fixed these issues, but it's important to understand why they were introduced in the first place and prevent them in the future.

## High Priority Issues

None. The `trim-trailing-whitespace` hook automatically fixed the issues. However, preventing these issues from reoccurring is important.

## Medium Priority Issues

*   **Trailing Whitespace Prevention:**  While the hook fixed the issues, it's crucial to prevent them from being introduced in the first place. This involves educating developers and configuring IDEs to automatically remove trailing whitespace on save.

## Low Priority Issues

None.

## File-by-File Analysis

*   **`src/dewey/core/base_script.py`**: Trailing whitespace was automatically removed.
    *   Error: Trailing whitespace.
    *   Description:  The file contained one or more lines with whitespace characters (spaces, tabs) at the end of the line.
    *   Recommended Fix: Ensure your editor/IDE is configured to automatically remove trailing whitespace on save.
    *   Potential Impact: Minor.  Can affect readability and potentially cause issues with diffs/merges.

*   **`scripts/quick_fix.py`**: Trailing whitespace was automatically removed.
    *   Error: Trailing whitespace.
    *   Description:  The file contained one or more lines with whitespace characters (spaces, tabs) at the end of the line.
    *   Recommended Fix: Ensure your editor/IDE is configured to automatically remove trailing whitespace on save.
    *   Potential Impact: Minor.  Can affect readability and potentially cause issues with diffs/merges.

*   **`src/dewey/llm/litellm_utils.py`**: Trailing whitespace was automatically removed.
    *   Error: Trailing whitespace.
    *   Description:  The file contained one or more lines with whitespace characters (spaces, tabs) at the end of the line.
    *   Recommended Fix: Ensure your editor/IDE is configured to automatically remove trailing whitespace on save.
    *   Potential Impact: Minor.  Can affect readability and potentially cause issues with diffs/merges.

*   **`src/dewey/llm/litellm_client.py`**: Trailing whitespace was automatically removed.
    *   Error: Trailing whitespace.
    *   Description:  The file contained one or more lines with whitespace characters (spaces, tabs) at the end of the line.
    *   Recommended Fix: Ensure your editor/IDE is configured to automatically remove trailing whitespace on save.
    *   Potential Impact: Minor.  Can affect readability and potentially cause issues with diffs/merges.

## Common Patterns

*   **Trailing Whitespace:** The recurring issue is trailing whitespace in Python files. This is a common problem, especially when developers use different editors or IDEs with varying configurations.

## Implementation Plan

1.  **Commit the changes:** The `trim-trailing-whitespace` hook already modified the files.  Commit these changes to the repository.

2.  **Configure IDEs/Editors:**
    *   **VS Code:** Add the following to your `settings.json` file:
        ```json
        {
            "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true
        }
        ```
    *   **PyCharm/IntelliJ IDEA:** Go to `Settings` -> `Editor` -> `General` and enable "Strip trailing spaces on Save" for "Modified lines" or "All".
    *   **Sublime Text:** Add the following to your `Preferences.sublime-settings` file:
        ```json
        {
            "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true
        }
    ```
    *   **Other Editors:** Consult the editor's documentation for instructions on how to automatically remove trailing whitespace on save.

3.  **Educate Developers:**  Inform the development team about the importance of avoiding trailing whitespace and how to configure their editors to prevent it.  Share the IDE/editor configuration examples above.

4.  **Review Pre-commit Configuration (Optional):**  While the current configuration works, review the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file to ensure it's up-to-date and includes other useful hooks (e.g., `black`, `flake8`, `isort`).  This can help catch other code quality issues automatically.  For example:

    ```yaml
    repos:
    -   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
        rev: v4.5.0 # Use the latest version
        hooks:
        -   id: trailing-whitespace
        -   id: end-of-file-fixer
        -   id: check-yaml
        -   id: check-added-large-files
    -   repo: https://github.com/psf/black
        rev: 24.2.0 # Use the latest version
        hooks:
        -   id: black
    -   repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
        rev: 7.0.0 # Use the latest version
        hooks:
        -   id: flake8
    ```

By following this plan, you can address the identified issues and prevent them from recurring in the future, leading to a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.
